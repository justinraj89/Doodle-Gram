# DoodleGram

DoodleGram is an application I developed for artists to showcase their art. In this application, you have the ability to login, post your own Artwork (including a Title, and short description of your art), and comment on other users posts. You may also edit/delete your own post(s).

If you do not log in, you will still have the ability to view all of the Artwork, along with the comments belonging to each post.
